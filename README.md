#### Built with

#### Before running
To run this code, it's necessary an api key from The Movie Database API. In this project I used git ignore for don't send a file with my api key. Please, create a file named *TMDB_api_Key.xml*. Inside this file add line like:
*<string name="TheMovieDB_ApiKey">YOUR API_KEY HERE</string>*.
